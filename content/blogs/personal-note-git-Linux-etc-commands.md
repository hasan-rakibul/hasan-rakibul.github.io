Title: Personal note on git, Linux, etc. commands
Date: 2023-04-16 00:00

Personal note of anything (git, Linux, etc.) I would like to find out easily.

# git

## General commands

- `git mv <current filename> <new filename (with dir to move)>`: move or rename file that is already tracked by git
- `git rm --cached <file1> <dir/file2>`: remove file1 and file2 from repository, especially required when `.gitignore` is updated to avoid tracking file1 and file2, which was earlier tracked and now on repository. This will NOT remove the file from the current local system. "Be aware to commit all your changes before, otherwise you will loose control on all the changed files" - [Hoang Pham at SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139762/ignore-files-that-have-already-been-committed-to-a-git-repository#comment1985104_1139797)

## Fix local configuration after changing repo name
- `git remote -v` to check current repo name
- `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<new-repo-name>.git`: update origin

## Roll back to a specific commit after pushed to remote
- `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`: reset to a specific commit. Get the commit hash from `git log` or GitHub commit history
- `git push -f origin main`: force push to remote
Caution: This will remove all commits after the specified commit hash.

## Colflict with git push/pull
- Here's a [nice SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71774640) that describe the merge options.
- I had some remote commits that I didn't pull before commiting from local. As usual, the push failed as I haven't fetched the changes. Simple `git pull` wasn't successful. Rather, `git pull --rebase` worked. It pulls and rebases local commits on top of remote commits.

## Configuring local machine to access (pull, push, etc.) GitHub private and public repositories. 

### Local machine &ndash; generate SSH key
- [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux)
- Local machine &ndash; set global username and email
```
git config --global user.name <NAME>
git config --global user.email <EMAIL>
```

### GitHub &ndash; add local machine's SSH key
- [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux)

&nbsp;

# Linux
- `mkdir dir_name{01..12}`: create dir_name01, dir_name02 ... dir_name12 directories
- `du -sh [dir]`: disk usage summary in human readable form, optinally for a specific directory
- `du -h [dir] | sort -h`: disk usage in human readable form sorted, optinally for a specific directory
- `du -sh --inode [dir]`: disk inode usage summary in human readable form, optinally for a specific directory

## Managing permissions
- `chmod u+x <file>`: add execute permission for **user**
- `chmod [-R] g+rwx <file[dir]>`: add read, write, execute permission for **group**
- `chmod [-R] o+rwx <file[dir]>`: add read, write, execute permission for **others**
- `chmode [-R] a+rwx <file[dir]>`: add read, write, execute permission for **all**
- `chmod [-R] g-rwx <file[dir]>`: remove read, write, execute permission for **group**
- `chmod [-R] o-rwx <file[dir}>`: remove read, write, execute permission for **others**

# LaTeX
## Natbib-style citation in IEEE template
I like the `\citep` and `\citet` commands to automatically mention author names. To use them in IEEE template, I need to add the following lines in the preamble:
```latex
\usepackage[backend=biber,style=ieee,natbib=true,maxcitenames=2,mincitenames=1]{biblatex}
\renewcommand{\bibfont}{\footnotesize} % 8 pt as in template
\addbibresource{<bibfile>.bib}
``` 
Further to enable `\IEEEtriggeratref{<number>}` to balance the reference list at last page, I need to add the following lines in the preamble according to [this StackExchange answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/316282):
```latex
\usepackage{ifthen}

\makeatletter
\newcounter{IEEE@bibentries}
\renewcommand\IEEEtriggeratref[1]{%
  \renewbibmacro{finentry}{%
    \stepcounter{IEEE@bibentries}%
    \ifthenelse{\equal{\value{IEEE@bibentries}}{#1}}
    {\finentry\@IEEEtriggercmd}
    {\finentry}%
  }%
}
\makeatother
```


## LaTeX Error: Unicode character ÃÅ (U+0301)
- Using XeLaTex would solve but sometimes we need to stick to pdfLaTeX
- The main problem to locate the character since it usually exist in the bib file. An excellent hack, as suggested in [this StackExchange answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/487565), is to print something strange in place of the character:

    Put `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0301}{*************************************}` in the preamble (before `\begin{document}`) and find the asterisks on the pdf.

    After locating it, the final fix in my case was replacing `\'\i` by `\'{i}`

## JFST Editorial Manager was not using bibtex/biber to compile *.bib file
The solution is to link the *.bbl file, which is actually a compiled version of the *.bib file

- `BibTeX` user: Access the `*.bbl` file and change the main `*.tex` file: Comment out `\bibliography{bib-file}` and place `<contents from the .bbl file>`

- `BibLaTeX` user: For `biber` backend, the [biblatex-readbbl](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-readbbl?lang=en) package worked fine in Overleaf and local machine but not in the Editorial Manager. Just include `something.bbl` and change the main `tex` file: Comment out `\addbibresource{ref.bib}` and place `\usepackage[bblfile=something]{biblatex-readbbl}`

# Python
## No module named pip

Install pip via apt:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
## Change default python version.

Create alias. Inside `~/.bashrc` or if it is linked to `~/.bash_aliases`:
```bash
alias python3='/usr/bin/python3.11'
```
- ImportError: cannot import name '_imaging' from 'PIL'

Upgrade `Pillow`:
```bash
python -m pip install -U Pillow
```
## Package installation failed due to setuptools (although setuptools>40 was installed): 'ERROR: No matching distribution found for setuptools>=40.8.0'. Randomly tried the following command and it worked: 
```bash
python -m pip install -U wheel
```

## Creating python virtual environment
Inside your preferred directory (it's standard to name it as `.venv` directory):
```bash
python -m venv <env_name>
```
Pro tip: Make `include-system-site-packages = true` in `<env_name>/pyvenv.cfg` file to include system-wide packages available in the virtual envirorment as well

Activate virtual environment. (better: put this command in `~/.bashrc` if it's your default environment. Then you don't need to activate it everytime.)
```bash
source <target/directory/with/env_name>/bin/activate
```

Or, if you don't need the environment everytime. You can activate in each terminal session using the same command above.

To deactivate the current environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Configuring cache directory
- `pip`: Add `export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/<target-dir>` in `~/.bashrc`
- `conda`: Add `conda config --add pkgs_dirs /<target-dir>` in `~/.bashrc`
  - Alternatively, `conda config` will create a `.condarc` file in home directory. Open it, and add the following lines:
```bash
envs_dirs:
  - /scratch2/<ident>/.conda/envs
pkgs_dirs:
  - /scratch2/<ident>/.conda/pkgs
```

## Install older version of Python (e.g., python3.9) in Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS  

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-distutils
```

Normally, `python` command will point to the latest version. To point it to specific version, you can include the version (e.g., `python3.9`) in the command.

## PyTorch
- `len(dataloader)`: number of batches
- `len(dataloader.dataset)`: number of samples

# VS Code
## Not finding virtual environment
- As discussed in [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68169595), I need to go 'Select Interpreter' and can select the virtual environment through the file explorer.
- Alternatively, as mentioned [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments): 'Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings. Then set `python.defaultInterpreterPathInterpreter` to the path of the virtual environment.'

## Connecting remote host through SSH
- As discussed [here in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_ssh-tips), I need to specify the public key in the remote host from my local PC. 

- If the local machine is a macOS or Linux, terminal:
```bash
export USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
export PUBKEYPATH="$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"

ssh-copy-id -i "$PUBKEYPATH" "$USER_AT_HOST"
```

- If the local machine is Windows, PowerShell:

```bash
$USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
$PUBKEYPATH="$HOME\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub"

$pubKey=(Get-Content "$PUBKEYPATH" | Out-String); ssh "$USER_AT_HOST" "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && echo '${pubKey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
- Then I can connect to the remote host through SSH passphrase instead of the remote login password. Passphrase is associated with every SSH key when we generate the key.
- Pretty convenient (it won't ask for a passphrase) if the passphrase is empty. To change SSH passphrase for a key, in PowerShell:
```bash
ssh-keygen -p
```

# WSL
## Ubuntu in WSL2 not starting up, both the Ubuntu terminal and VS Code
- Restart the Ubuntu. In PowerShell:
    ```bash
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

# Others
## Change JupyerLab startup directory
As discussed in [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35254852/how-to-change-the-jupyter-start-up-folder):

- `jupyter server --generate-config` will generate `jupyter_server_config.py` in `~/.jupyter/` directory
- Uncomment/write `c.ServerApp.root_dir = </your/preferred/directory/>`

## Ububtu WSL2 opens as root
- As discussed [here in Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/x4xuek/ubuntu_has_started_defaulting_to_root_user_on/), I need to change the default user to my username. In PowerShell:
```bash
ubuntu config --default-user <username>
```
- The correct username can be found in `/etc/passwd`

## Zoom Recording
- While sharing the screen, 'optimize for video clip' option creates black boxes at different parts of shared screen (maybe the idea is to create black box on Zoom software-related pop-ups, but maybe buggy as of Nov 23.). So, I should share the screen without this option.
- If I minimise my video, it will not be recorded.

## Convert pdf to image in Linux
- As mentioned [here in askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/50180): `pdftoppm input.pdf outputname [-png / -jpeg / etc.] -r <resolution>`
