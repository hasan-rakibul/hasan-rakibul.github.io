# Getting a car driver's license at Western Australia
## Computerised Theory Test
- The official drive safe handbook is a very good resource to know about road rules.
- Official practice question can be found [here](https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/rules-of-the-road.asp).
- In addition, practice questions from other states (and other non-official websites and apps) can be a good resource.
## Hazard Perception Test
- The official practice test of WA can be found [here](https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/hazard-perception-test.asp). Practice test for motorcycle and moped are also applicable (and recommended) for car.
- I think VIC and WA are similar in this regard. 
    - The official practice test of VIC can be found [here](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/licences/your-ps/get-your-ps/hazard-perception-practice-test).
    - I think VIC offers HPT tests from home. Accordingly several recordings of HPT tests can be found on YouTube. **I found these very helpful** (search: 'hpt vic'; some results: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGpSJT90afk), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYOsfvN0HM), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0983GCxX3n8), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgQSAIkhR7o), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqfxnYwpeF4), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoVNiZoKTgA), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H40Uu_4SDOc)). I didn't find all questions same (but I think some are) as WA, but the concept and overall background/resolution are the same.
- There are several non-official websites that offer practice tests. I didn't find them very helpful, mostly because the background/resolution are not the same as actual test. Nevertheless, they can be thought of extra practice material to get used to the concept (example [here](https://www.easydrivingtest.com.au/driver-knowledge-tests/hpt/)).
- SA practice test can be found [here](https://mylicence.sa.gov.au/hazard-perception-test), but these doesn't match with WA in terms of background/resolution.
## Resources
- Drive Safe Handbook is the official guidebook. Can be downloaded from [here](https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/rules-of-the-road.asp).
- [DriveSmart Onliny by VIC government](http://drivesmart.vic.gov.au/) can be a good resource for becoming a good driver.
