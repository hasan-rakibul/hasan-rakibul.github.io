<p>Writing a postgraduate thesis is stressful and would be horrendous without a helpful template.</p>

<p>I received my MSc Eng degree from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) in 2021. Officially, the university only provided a <a href="https://www.kuet.ac.bd/images/forms/ACAF_5.pdf">PDF</a>, mentioning the formatting requirement of the thesis. Writing the thesis in MS Word was an easy option as the guidelines were MS Word-complaint. I, however, decided to use LaTeX as I always have been pleased with the beauty and power of what LaTeX can do.</p>

<p>I tried my best to replicate the template in LaTeX. However, future users are requested to check for any deviations from the guidelines.</p>
    
<p>With the hope of helping future students, I now release this "unofficial" LaTeX template following the "official" guidelines as an <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/KUET Postgrad (MSc-MScEng-MPhil-PhD) Thesis-Dissertation">Overleaf template</a>.</p>

<p>The version 1.0 includes the following files:
    <ul>
        <li>main.tex: main tex file where the thesis/dissertation would be written</li>
        <li>package-settings.tex: required packages with their appropriate settings to follow the guidelines are referenced here</li>
        <li>all_references.bib: the bibliography file where the BibTeX of all references should be placed</li>
        <li>./Figures: the folder where all figures should be placed</li>
        <li>BOOK COVER PAGE: the cover page of the final book, usually needs to be supplied to the bookbinding office/shop. Docx version is provided as normally most bookbinding office needs an editable version in MS word, not LaTeX.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Although I sometimes felt terrible about implementing the stringent requirements, in the end, I loved it. It was when I had to find answers to questions never asked in StackExchange, Reddit, or any related sites. The documentation of packages really helped me out.</p>
