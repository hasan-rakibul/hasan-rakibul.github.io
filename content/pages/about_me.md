Title: About Me

I'm currently a PhD student at <a href="https://research.curtin.edu.au/work-with-us/optus-centre-for-artificial-intelligence/">Optus 5G lab, a.k.a. Optus Centre for Artificial Intelligence,</a> of Curtin University, Australia. Supervised by <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/">Professor Tom Gedeon</a>, I aim to develop neural architectures to detect empathy in videos.

I'm on leave from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University (BRACU)</a>, Bangladesh, where I am a Senior Lecturer in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) Department. I am with BRAC University since October 2020. Before joining BRACU, I worked as a full-time lecturer in the EEE department of <a href="https://www.baiust.edu.bd/">Bangladesh Army International University of Science & Technology</a> for more than one and a half years.
    
I received BSc (2019) and MSc (2021) degrees in EEE from <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Khulna, Bangladesh</a>. I am actively involved in research on applied machine learning, biomedical signal processing, internet of things, and embedded systems. As a young academician, I have several peer-reviewed publications on applied deep learning and machine learning.
    
I was a champion of the “<a href="https://www.huawei.com/minisite/seeds-for-the-future/index.html">Seeds for the Future</a> 2018” program by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., leading to a sponsored visit to China for two weeks. I'm passionate about learning new things. To date, I completed 25 certified courses on machine learning, deep learning, and data science from renowned online platforms, such as Coursera and DataCamp.
