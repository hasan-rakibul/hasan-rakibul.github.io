Title: About Me

I'm currently serving as a Lecturer in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) Department at <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University (BRACU), Dhaka, Bangladesh</a>. Before joining BRACU, I worked as a full-time lecturer in the EEE department of <a href="https://www.baiust.edu.bd/">Bangladesh Army International University of Science & Technology (BAIUST)</a> for more than one and a half years.
    
I received B.Sc. (2019) and M.Sc. (2021) degrees in EEE from <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Khulna, Bangladesh</a>. Along with teaching, I love to do and learn research with global collaboration. In particular, my research interests include applied machine learning, biomedical signal processing, IoT, and embedded systems. I worked on deep learning applications in Bengali speech recognition in my Bachelor's and Master's thesis. As a young academician, I have a few peer-reviewed publications related to applied deep learning and machine learning. I love to help students in research activities.
    
I was a champion of the “<a href="https://www.huawei.com/minisite/seeds-for-the-future/index.html">Seeds for the Future</a> 2018” program by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., leading to a sponsored visit to China for two weeks. I'm passionate about works involving programming. To date, I completed 25 certified courses on machine learning, deep learning, and data science from renowned online platforms, such as Coursera and DataCamp.
