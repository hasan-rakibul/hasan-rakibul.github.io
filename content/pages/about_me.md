Title: About me

I'm a PhD student in Computing at 'Human-Centric Group in AI' at Curtin Perth campus. I'm fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/">Professor Tom Gedeon</a>, <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/">Dr Md Zakir Hossain</a> and <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/aneesh-krishna-1b4c5581/">A/Professor Aneesh Krishna</a>, with whom I'm investigating deep learning technologies to detect empathy in human interactions. My overall research interest includes advancing affective computing and multimodal signal processing using deep learning algorithms.

In addition to research, I'm keen on teaching. I've been tutoring as a casual academic at Curtin. I'm on leave from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a>, Bangladesh, where I currently hold a Senior Lecturer position. I also lectured full-time at the <a href="https://www.baiust.edu.bd/">Bangladesh Army International University of Science & Technology</a>.

I received BSc (2019) and MSc (2021) degrees from <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology</a>, Bangladesh. I was a champion of the '<a href="https://www.huawei.com/minisite/seeds-for-the-future/index.html">Seeds for the Future</a> 2018' program by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., leading to a two-week sponsored visit to China.

I am a big fan of open online learning and have completed over 25 certified courses on machine learning, deep learning, and data science from Coursera, DataCamp and other similar platforms.
