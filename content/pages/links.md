# Others
## Photo - remove current background and use a different one
- Adobe Photoshop: straightforward with generative AI prompting
As I wanted to use another picture's background, I removed subject while keeping the background and filling the gap with generative AI.
After placing the subject on the new background, one important factor to make the editing smooth is matching colour exposures. [This YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE019S74t2o&t=760s) shows how to blend the subject and background.
- [Retoucher](https://retoucher.online/upload): There are a varieties of background options (can new background be uploaded as well), have different size options for downloading. No sign-up required for the first three downloads.
- [fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/backgrounds.html): Preview (lower quality) can be downloaded w/o sign up. Have similar others features as above.
