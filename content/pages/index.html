    <p>I'm a PhD candidate and academic staff member in Computing at Curtin University, Australia. My PhD is centred on developing novel methods with foundational models for robust empathy detection in text and video interactions. Such an objective empathy assessment is well-positioned to ensure equitable empathy training in healthcare, education, and social support. One of my PhD publications has recently been awarded as the <strong>"Best Publication"</strong> in the EECMS HDR Forum at Curtin. 
    <!-- I have been supervised by <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/">Professor Tom Gedeon</a>, <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/">Dr Md Zakir Hossain</a> and <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/aneesh-krishna-1b4c5581/">Professor Aneesh Krishna</a>.  -->
    My overarching research interest include advancing deep learning algorithms across different natural language processing and computer vision problems.</p>

    <p>I received BSc (2019) and MSc (2021) degrees from <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology</a>, Bangladesh. In 2024, I received the <i>Quality Journal Publication Award</i> from BRAC University for two of my publications between January and June 2023. I received a few grants, including a <strong>research grant</strong> in 2024-2025 from BRAC University and three <strong>compute grants</strong> in 2025 and 2024 from the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, Australia. I championed the "<a href="https://www.huawei.com/minisite/seeds-for-the-future/index.html">Seeds for the Future</a> 2018" program, sponsored by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.</p>

    <p>In addition to research, I'm keen on teaching. I have lectured several undergraduate and postgraduate units, supervised several research students, designed curricula across universities in Australia and Bangladesh since 2019. At my current role in Curtin, I'm the Unit Coordinator and Lecturer for ICTE3002 (Human Computer Interface), ICTE5001 (Advanced Human Computer Interface), and ISEC6000 (Secure DevOps). Previously, I lectured full-time at <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a> and <a href="https://www.baiust.edu.bd/">Bangladesh Army International University of Science & Technology</a>.</p>
