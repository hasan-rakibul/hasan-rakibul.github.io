    <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Computing at 'Human-Centric Group in AI' at Curtin Perth campus. I'm fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/">Professor Tom Gedeon</a>, <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/">Dr Md Zakir Hossain</a> and <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/aneesh-krishna-1b4c5581/">Professor Aneesh Krishna</a>, with whom I'm developing novel deep learning systems to detect empathy in human interactions. My overarching research interest includes advancing deep learning algorithms for natural language processing and computer vision.</p>
    <!-- I am research how foundation model, such as large language model, can contribute to detecting empathy in interactions. I hope to... This will benefit -->

    <p>In addition to research, I'm keen on teaching. I've been tutoring as a casual academic at Curtin University and Murdoch University. I'm on leave from <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a>, Bangladesh, where I currently hold a senior lecturer position. I also lectured full-time at the <a href="https://www.baiust.edu.bd/">Bangladesh Army International University of Science & Technology</a>.</p>

    <p>I received BSc (2019) and MSc (2021) degrees from <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology</a>, Bangladesh. In 2024, I received the 'Quality Journal Publication Award' from BRAC University for two of my publications between January and June 2023. I received a few grants, including a <strong>research grant</strong> in 2024-2025 from BRAC University and three <strong>compute grants</strong> in 2025 and 2024 from the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, Australia. I championed the "<a href="https://www.huawei.com/minisite/seeds-for-the-future/index.html">Seeds for the Future</a> 2018" program by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.</p>

    <p>I am a big fan of open online learning and have completed over 25 certified courses on machine learning, deep learning and data science from Coursera, DataCamp and other similar platforms.</p>
